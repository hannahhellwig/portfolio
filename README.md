# Sprint 3 – Your Very Own Portfolio

It's about time you show the world the wonders that you're now capable of building – it's time to build your portfolio. The portfolio should feature projects you have built so far and some information about yourself and your background, and, if you'd like, your contact details.

The portfolio will be built up in three steps over three days and built in React. Today we will focus on getting the basics in place. Next session will be about connecting several pages with routing in React and navigating between them. The final session will be about deployment – that's when we will go live with previous projects and the portfolio.

The task for today is to build the front and also repeat some of your React skills. 

The portfolio contains of: 
* Landing page - the page which lists all your projects and could briefly mention who you are.
* Project pages - a page which will be used to describe a project (daily assignment or group project) with images, a description, a list of technologies used and a link to the project live (Will be added on session 3).

You can choose to either create one project page per project so you can style them each manually, or to create a reusable page which can use a json file as a "database" and use a parameter in the url to choose which project to show. For example the url /projects/123 would find a project with an id 123 in the json and use data in the json to fill in the page.

*If you plan to let us match you with comanies in the end of the program we want you to use the design that are provided in the assets folder. For the assignment – focus on the tech side and getting good at building React projects. For the matchning process, also the content becomes important. This is a page that we will use to profile you towards companies. The deadline to "finish" your portfolio is on the 14th of october to be able to get feedback. However, your portfolio will need constant updates with new projects from now on.*

If you don't want our help getting interviews, feel free to build the portfolio anyway you like. Here's some examples.

## How to complete this assignment

### Tech specifications

Use the skills you've learnt so far in React to create the components needed for this step in the project. Remember, we'll be coming back tomorrow with step 2 to learn how to deal with navigating between the pages. So today just focus on making the pages.

### Project setup

Because this is your portfolio, you will own the repository! On Github, create a new repository for yourself to get started. You can initialize it with a README if you'd like - it doesn't really matter. Once you have your repository, clone it onto your computer and then download the [Technigo React Starter project](https://github.com/Technigo/react-starter/releases/latest). Unzip the starter project and copy all the files into your repository. Don't forget to commit! ;)

:warning: Code reviews are difficult without Pull Requests, so if you want a code review on this one you have to ask for one in Slack and link to your code. :warning:

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language you're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your team.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask a coach. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After finishing this assignment you should have the start of your very own portfolio. You should also know more about how to work with React and components and props, and how to start a new project from scratch.

### :runner: Stretch Goals

There is no set stretch goals for this assignment. Since this is your portfolio I bet you have a million things you would like to add. Go nuts!
